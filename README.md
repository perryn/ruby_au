## Project Overview

This is a Rails 8.0+ application using a "lean engines" pattern for managing multiple Ruby community sites:

- **Main App**: Core Ruby Australia website at `ruby.org.au`
- **Site Engines**: City-specific sites in the `sites/` directory (e.g., `melbourne.ruby.org.au`)

**Tech Stack**: Rails + Vite + Hotwire + TailwindCSS + PostgreSQL

## Development

**Setup:**

```bash
bin/install-hooks  # First time only
bin/setup          # Install dependencies and prepare database
```

**Run the app:**

```bash
bin/dev  # Starts Vite + Puma + background jobs
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
bin/tests   # Full test suite (RSpec + Rubocop)
bin/rspec   # RSpec only
```
