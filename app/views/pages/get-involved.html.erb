      </p>
      <p>
        The Mentored Contributions Program helps connect enthusiastic community members with
        experienced Rubyists &mdash; building skills, confidence, and lasting connections.

        This program is open to anyone who wants to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>learn to contribute to open source projects (as a <em>mentee</em>), or</li>
        <li>support others through their experience (as a <em>mentor</em>).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üßë‚Äçüè´ For Mentors (Experienced Rubyists)</h3>
      <p>
        Mentors are the backbone of the program. By sharing your experience, you'll help new
        contributors grow while keeping our community projects active and welcoming.
      </p>

      <h4>What's involved</h4>
      <p>
        Commit around 1 hour per month to review, answer questions, or offer short mentoring
        sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Help mentees understand contribution flow, testing, and communication practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give constructive feedback and celebrate their wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your time can be flexible &mdash; if your mentee doesn't need help on a task, you can use it
        for broader discussions about their personal projects, open source, community projects, or
        Ruby itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't need to be a core contributor or long-time maintainer. If you can review code,
        explain a change, or help someone debug setup issues, you're perfect.
      </p>

      <h4>Recognition</h4>
      <p>
        Mentors will be publicly acknowledged (but only if they'd like to be).
